## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r itial}
library(tidyverse)

### I need to 1) create a heat map from the mutural rank data and 2) a line graph from the tpm data by tissue type

# 1) Heat map

exp.data <- read_csv("data/Comparisson_Matrix_file.csv")


str(exp.data)
head(exp.data)

exp.heatmap <- ggplot(data = exp.data, mapping = aes(x = Node1_T,
                                                     y = Node2,
                                                     fill = Mutual_Rank)) +
  geom_tile()

exp.heatmap 

exp.data$log.expression <- log(exp.data$Mutual_Rank)

exp.heatmap.log <- ggplot(data = exp.data, mapping = aes(x = Node1_T,
                                                         y = Node2,
                                                         fill = log.expression)) +
  geom_tile() +
  xlab(label = "Gene1") + # Add a nicer x-axis title
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(), # Remove the y-axis title
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5)) # Rotate the x-axis labels

exp.heatmap.log

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
